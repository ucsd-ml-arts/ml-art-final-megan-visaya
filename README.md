# Final Project

Megan Visaya, mvisaya@ucsd.edu

## Abstract Proposal

In the spirit of this class, of my identity as an engineer, and of my faith, I wanted to highlight the relationship between the 
aesthetics of patterns found in nature using imagery that is often studied by biologists, astronomers, physicists, etc. 
I hope to create outputs that reflect the consistency, stability, and beauty of these structures, and start a conversation on how they 
can be used as a confirmation of the mastery of a Creator or evidence against Their existence. I plan to use a visual GAN to
produce images that emphasize these patterns by training a discriminator with alike images that depict different objects (e.g., cells 
vs. supernovas, neural pathways vs. superclusters, honeycombs vs. turtle shells), and will display my results digitally for our final 
presentations.

## Project Report

Upload your project report (4 pages) as a pdf with your repository, following this template: [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133H59WZBmH6MlAgFSskFLMQITeIC5d9b2iuzsOfa4E8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- Please download the dataset here (400~ MB): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ccJBDSJXagpVSkpvbKEyB5NzlrAROBLJ/view?usp=sharing 

## Code

For generating training data:
- Python: img_downloads.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- What you include here will very much depend on the format of your final project
  - image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
  - 3d models
  - movie files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
  - audio files
  - ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
